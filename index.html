    <p>She don't believe in shootin' stars<br>
    But she believe in shoes and cars<br>
    Wood floors in the new apartment<br>
    Couture from the store's departments<br>
    You more like love to start shit<br>
    I'm more of the trips to Florida<br>
    Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water<br>
    Straight from a page of your favorite author<br>
    And the weather so breezy<br>
    Man, why can't life always be this easy?<br>
    She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy<br>
    I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"<br>
    And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte<br>
    'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi<br>
    Damn, these niggas got me<br>
    I hate these niggas more than the Nazis</p>
    
    <p>As I recall, I know you love to show off<br>
    But I never thought that you would take it this far<br>
    But what do I know?<br>
    Flashing lights<br>
    What do I know? Know<br>
    Flashing lights<br>
    See upcoming pop shows<br>
    Get tickets for your favorite artists</p>
    
    <p>I know it's been a while, sweetheart<br>
    We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing<br>
    I know I was foul, baby<br>
    A-bay, lately, you've been all on my brain<br>
    And if somebody would've told me a month ago<br>
    Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know<br>
    If somebody would've told me a year ago<br>
    It'll go get this difficult<br>
    Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA<br>
    Like Martin with no Gina<br>
    Like a flight with no visa<br>
    First class with the seat back, I still see ya<br>
    In my past, you on the other side of the glass<br>
    Of my memory's museum<br>
    I'm just sayin', "Hey, Mona Lisa<br>
    Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar"</p>
    
    <p>As I recall, I know you love to show off<br>
    But I never thought that you would take it this far<br>
    But what do I know?<br>
